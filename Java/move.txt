Effect: Petal Dance's user must make another Ranged attack for 1d2 more turns. The attack is identical to Petal Dance except for Petal Dance's effect. Petal Dance creates a 3-meter Burst, but only on the first round of its use. After the first use is declared, Petal Dance targets the nearest Legal Target for its second or third round of use if the original target is unconscious. If potential targets are an equal distance from the user, you may choose the target. After Petal Dance's additional use(s) end(s), the user becomes Confused. For Pokemon users, the additional 1d2 are their Trainer's Command Actions, unless the Trainer is unconscious, in which case the Pokemon acts on its own until finished.
